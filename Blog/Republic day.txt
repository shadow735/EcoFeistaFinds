One of the most iconic features of Republic Day celebrations is the grand parade that takes place in the heart of New Delhi, at Rajpath. 
This event showcases India's military might, cultural diversity, and technological achievements.
The President of India hoists the national flag, and the Prime Minister lays a wreath at the Amar Jawan Jyoti to honor the sacrifices of soldiers.
The parade includes marching contingents, tableaus representing different states, and a mesmerizing display by the armed forces.

**Cultural Extravaganza:**

Republic Day is not just about military parades; it's also a celebration of India's cultural mosaic. 
Various states present their vibrant cultures through folk dances, music, and art. 
This cultural diversity is a testament to India's unity in diversity, showcasing the country's pluralistic ethos.

Republic Day evokes a deep sense of patriotism among Indians. 
Schools, colleges, and communities organize flag-hoisting ceremonies, singing of the national anthem, and cultural programs. 
The tricolor flag is proudly displayed in every nook and corner of the country, symbolizing the unity and integrity of India.
